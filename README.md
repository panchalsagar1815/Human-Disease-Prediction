# Human-Disease-Prediction

# Project Title: Human Disease Prediction

## Project Overview:
The "Human Disease Prediction" project aims to develop an intelligent system that predicts human diseases based on a set of symptoms provided by the user. Leveraging feature engineering, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms, particularly the Random Forest Algorithm, the system will analyze a comprehensive list of symptoms to classify and predict various diseases accurately.

## Features:
The project incorporates a wide range of symptoms for disease prediction, including but not limited to:
- Itching
- Skin rash
- Nodal skin eruptions
- Continuous sneezing
- Shivering
- Chills
- Joint pain
- Stomach pain
- Acidity
- Ulcers on tongue
- Muscle wasting
- Vomiting
- Burning micturition
- Fatigue
- Weight gain
- Anxiety
- Cold hands and feets
- Mood swings
- Weight loss
- Restlessness
- Lethargy
- Patches in throat
- Irregular sugar level
- Cough
- High fever
- Sunken eyes
- Breathlessness
- Sweating
- Dehydration
- Indigestion
- Headache
- Yellowish skin
- Dark urine
- Nausea
- Loss of appetite
- ... and many more.

## Methodology:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a comprehensive dataset containing instances of various diseases with corresponding symptoms.

2. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Ensure that the dataset is suitable for training machine learning models.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from the dataset and create new features that may enhance the predictive capabilities of the model.

4. **Data Visualization:** Utilize data visualization techniques to gain insights into the relationships between symptoms and diseases. Visualize patterns, correlations, and important features for better understanding.

5. **Machine Learning Model:** Implement the Random Forest Algorithm for disease classification. Train the model on the cleaned and engineered dataset, optimizing parameters for improved accuracy.

6. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

7. **User Interface:** Develop an intuitive user interface allowing users to input their symptoms, and receive predictions on potential diseases.

## Expected Outcomes:
- Accurate disease prediction based on input symptoms.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Insights into the relationships between symptoms and diseases.
- Deployment-ready machine learning model.

This project aims to enhance early disease detection and contribute to better healthcare by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques.
